          Privacy Policy for Internal QA Testing Application
        </p>

        <p class="muted spacer-lg"><strong>Last Updated:</strong>
          <script>document.write(new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US',{year:'numeric',month:'long',day:'numeric'}))</script>
        </p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="spacer-lg">
          This Privacy Policy describes how the internal QA testing application ("Aero Pro") developed by Jacob Leone collects, uses, and protects
          information when used for hardware testing purposes by authorized personnel. This application is designed exclusively for internal
          quality assurance testing of hardware units and is not intended for public use.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <div class="indent spacer-lg">
          <p><strong>• Microphone Data:</strong> Audio captured for on‑device processing during active testing sessions to analyze hardware performance; it is not saved to the device and is not transmitted to third parties.</p>
          <p><strong>• Camera Data:</strong> Images/video captured for on‑device inspection during active testing sessions; they are not saved to the device and are not transmitted to third parties.</p>
          <p><strong>• Device Information:</strong> Basic device metadata including device model, operating system version, and app version for testing compatibility.</p>
          <p><strong>• Testing Data:</strong> Transient performance metrics and diagnostics computed on‑device during the session; they are not saved to the device and are not transmitted to third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The collected information is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <div class="indent spacer-lg">
          <p>• Conducting quality assurance testing of hardware units</p>
          <p>• Analyzing hardware performance and functionality</p>
          <p>• Generating test reports and documentation</p>
          <p>• Troubleshooting hardware issues and defects</p>
          <p>• Improving testing procedures and methodologies</p>
          <p>• No data is stored on the device or transmitted to any third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p class="spacer-lg">
          All processing occurs on‑device during the active testing session. The app does not store data on the device after the session ends and does not upload data to any server. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect information during on‑device processing.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p class="spacer-lg">
          We do not sell, share, or transfer your information to third parties. The app does not transmit data off the device and does not use third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Permissions and Access</h2>
        <p>The Aero Pro app requires the following permissions:</p>
        <div class="indent spacer-lg">
          <p><strong>• Microphone Permission:</strong> Required to capture audio during testing for on‑device analysis. Audio is processed during the active session, not saved to the device, and not transmitted.</p>
          <p><strong>• Camera Permission:</strong> Required to capture images or video during testing for on‑device inspection. Media are processed during the active session, not saved to the device, and not transmitted.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
        <p>As an authorized user of this internal testing application, you have the right to:</p>
        <div class="indent spacer-lg">
          <p>• Be informed about how the app uses device features like camera and microphone</p>
          <p>• Deny or revoke permissions for camera, microphone or storage access</p>
          <p>• Be assured that no personal data is stored or transmitted</p>
          <p>• Contact the development team with any questions or concerns</p>
          <p>• Request information about the app's privacy and security practices</p>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p class="spacer-lg">
          Test data and media files are never stored on the device or transmitted to any third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="spacer-lg">
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify users of
          any material changes through the App or other appropriate means. Continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of
          the updated Privacy Policy.
        </p>
